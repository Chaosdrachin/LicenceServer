<h3>Percepton-Based Hash Generatr</h3>

Requirements :

sklearn

<h2>How-To-Use</h2>

1. install requierements
2. Run Server
3. Write a Python Script wich sends via Socket the HASH : 7964A39FD138E6D456F8CCF43D2556E108055BF38303788E35F4BFD05D3E80A9
4. Reseive Hash

<h2>What is this Version ?</h2>

This is a Experimental Hash Creation system with Salt to create Licences for other software
to create New Hash Types 

just change the X and Y Data

for changing the SALT :
change this Line :
'''
# Set Security-Salt
salt = ["K$", "To", "P/", "&$GU", "ZzF", "%He", "%%hheUR", "Dra%g0N", "S4l1y", "M0Ar$", "%Sa17",
        "Uu", "!&", "/DkL", "[O]",  "Lp", "ErR", "%HK$", "DeT§", "%Rr&aW", "SzZ$B" "&UOg$", "$§"]
'''

this Array is Extendable ! add much you want :3


Enjoy


- ps : This Project is Non Commercial so 

If you create a own version -> add me to Credits !

Allowed :
Copy , Create own version , change stuff

Permitted :
Commercial Use

<hr>

TO DO for me :
TimeBased Licence Creation (actually you must restart this every time to create a new Hash
